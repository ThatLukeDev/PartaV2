A post quantum key exchange library written in Rust.

I'm in no way guaranteeing that, don't sue me.

Again, I don't guarantee that this software is fully quantum safe, do your own research.

Advances in quantum computing may also make the ring learning with errors key exchange obsolete.

As a backup, im planning on making the key exchange also use ECDH or RSA as it would be easy to integrate into the key exchange with no other exchange steps.
